# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: blocks in Ruby are similar to anonymous functions just like in JavaScript. It is a function that gets passed into a method and can be defined 2 ways. They can be declared by the keyword "do" and an "end" statement or inside curly braces. I've had experience using blocks while using a ".each"," .map", and ".select" when iterating through values in Ruby.

  Researched answer: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. Blocks are enclosed in a do-end statement or curly braces {}. Do-end is usually used for blocks that span through multiple lines, while curly braces {} are used for a single line block. Blocks can have arguments which are defined between to pipe || characters. 



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: Ruby gems software allows you to easily download, install, and use Ruby software packages on your system. The package is called a "gem" which contains a package or applications and library. The first time I encountered "gem" is during Ruby testing, I used the command "gem install rspec" for Ruby to install the required package and library in order to set up a test file.

  Researched answer: Ruby gems is a package manager for the ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing ruby programs and libraries. It is a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. 



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a Ruby language framework that includes the MVC architecture which stands for Model, View, and Controller. The model is the brains and the logic that handles the application database, view is what is displayed on the application, and controller is the interaction between user and application. 

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It is a model-view-controller framework providing default structures for a database, web-service and web pages. 



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: a relational database is a database that includes a table of rows and columns filled with different kinds of information. Pretty similar to an excel spreadsheet which everyone have mostly encountered. Relational database are used to store data, update, edit and remove data. A perfect example would be a user creating a new account on a website. All information filled by that user will be stored in a database. I have experienced working with microsoft sql server and postgresql but no other kind of databases.

  Researched answer: A relational databases are also called SQL database which stands for Standard Query Language and its the language relational databases are written in. SQL is used to execute queries, retrieve data, edit data by updating, deleting, and creating new records. A non-relational database is any database that does not use the tabular schema or rows and columns like relational databases. Rather it's storage model is optimizsed for the type of data it's storing.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: in databases, primary keys are unique identifiers that sets each value different from the rest. A perfect example would be, if 2 of the same exact information is inputted in the database, the primary key would be the only value that would distinguishly set these 2 sets of information apart. As for my personal experience, while performing the challenges with databases on rails, when creating data, rails automatically creates the primary key for you starting from # "1".

  Researched answer: a primary key is a relationl database table column designated to uniquely identify each table record. Most of the time primary keys are set in a column, and identifies the rows in that table. It's mostly used to quickly sort or parse data within the table by addressing to it's primary key. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: its a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions. Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JSON which stands for JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute value pairs and arrays.

3. ERB: ERB which stands for embedded ruby is a templating system that embeds ruby into a text document. It is often used to embed ruby code in an HTML document, similar to ASP, JSP and PHP and other server-side scripting language.

4. Params: params is short for parameters. A parameter is a key value paid that is encoded in a HTTP request. There are three kinds of params: user supplied parameters, routing parameters, and default parameters.

5. API: an applicaation programming interface is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a serfice to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.
